'Label'  is the output feature. We have to train a CNN-BiLSTM model with 3 output classes: 0,1,2 which are NetBIOS, Benign and LDAP respectively. We are using a categorical cross entropy loss function with L2 regularization for multi-class classification. RELU for input layer. 3 hidden layers for CNN with 50 neurons each. RELU for each hidden layer. tanh/softmax for output layers.
